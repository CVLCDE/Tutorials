# Rougelike Tutorial

https://roguesharp.wordpress.com/

I wanted to get more practice with C# so I figured I would create a game. I've never coded a game before, so I decided to follow the roguelike tutorial linked above to get a feel for how to create one.

The code is not my own and I most likely won't finish the whole thing, however, I feel like I've learned enough to extract concepts from this tutorial and implement them in my own project in a few days from now.
